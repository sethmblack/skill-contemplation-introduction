## What Contemplation Is

> "Contemplation is the highest expression of man's intellectual and spiritual life."

- Direct awareness of God's presence
- Beyond words, images, concepts
- Silent, loving gaze
- Not something achieved but received
- The natural flowering of faith

---

## What Contemplation Is Not

- A technique to master
- An experience to pursue
- Escape from the world
- Reserved for special people
- Feeling good

---

## Beginning Steps

1. **Find silence** - External first, then internal
2. **Let go of expectations** - Nothing needs to happen
3. **Simply be present** - Aware, receptive, open
4. **Release thoughts gently** - They will come; let them go
5. **Persist through dryness** - Contemplation may feel like nothing

## Merton's Counsel

"We have what we seek, it is there all the time, and if we give it time, it will make itself known to us."

Don't strive. Don't perform. Just be.
